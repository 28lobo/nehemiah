- [ ] **Track: Refactor 'src/app/page.tsx'. It is currently a monolithic file and must be split into smaller components. 1. Extract the <header> into 'src/components/layout/Header.tsx'. 2. Extract the <footer> into 'src/components/layout/Footer.tsx'. 3. Extract the Masonry Grid section into 'src/components/home/MasonryGrid.tsx'. 4. Extract the News Ticker section into 'src/components/home/NewsTicker.tsx'. 5. Extract the Category Chips section into 'src/components/home/CategoryChips.tsx'. 6. Update 'src/app/page.tsx' to import and use these new components cleanly.**
